 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  The Hardware in the Loop (HIL) technique is fundamental for real-time simulations in order to connect
  a part of the system to a digital model. The technique consists in the entry of a physical device in
  the control loop over the system development. Currently, HIL simulations are mainly used for the 
  development of new components and actuators in several different fields such as: flight simulations, 
  electronic power systems, mobile robotics and traffic engineering. In the developed system, the HIL
  technique is applied to a simplified robotic manipulator for three revolution joints. The method was
  applied in three distinct steps. The first one consists on surveying the plant model and tuning the
  controller in a simulation environment. The second is the replacement of the virtual controller by
  its implementation in physical device followed by the validation with the simulation environment. Finally, the last step corresponds to the use of the controller implemented in the physical device communicating directly with the actual plant. The design makes use of the Raspberry single board computer as the hardware inserted into the mesh of the manipulator's control. Finally, the aim of the project is the tuning and validation of the control of independent joints of the manipulator in question applying the HIL technique.
